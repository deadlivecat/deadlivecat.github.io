      We are Dead Live Cat! A (yet) small group of computer scientists learning how to make computer games as an artistic expression. A team born from the need to stay in touch with each other during the 2020 global pandemic and the wishes of do something meaningful. Best is yet to come, and we will see you there.

      <p>
        Escape from Covid-19 is a game about our exacerbated need to go out when it is forbidden or not recommended. After several days of lockdown, the negation and projection start to act at collective level. The excuses to go out are stacking and the reasons to stay inside are less and less important. So do it, go out and get Covid-19. If you survive, don't forget to donate plasma.
      </p>
      <p> Rules are simple: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay away from other people</li>
        <li>Gel alcohol will help you, but is not a silver bullet.</li>
        <li>Police will send you back home unless you have a permit</li>
        <li>Chlorine Dioxide may help (no, it doesn't)</li>
